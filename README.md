# Manhunt

### What is Manhunt?
Manhunt is an app made by three friends (Muaz, Omar, and Julian) to extend the experience of the classic game of manhunt.

### How it works:
In the classic game of manhunt, when the hunter catches a runner, they are "it" with them. The last runner left wins the game.

With the Manhunt app, everyone playing can simoultaneously join a game that will track their locations in real-time and lets hunters see the locations of runners at regular intervals.
