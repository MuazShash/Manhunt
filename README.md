# Manhunt

### What is Manhunt?
Manhunt is an app made by three friends (Muaz, Omar, and Julian) to extend the experience of the classic game of manhunt.

### How it works:
In the classic game of manhunt, one person – called the hunter – is it. When the hunter catches a runner, they are "it" with them. The last runner left wins the game.

With the Manhunt app, everyone playing can simultaneously join a game that will track their locations in real-time and lets hunters see the locations of runners at regular intervals. This opens the playing field for more unique strategies and tactics from the hunters as well as allows for more variety in where and when you can play.

### How to play:
* Step 1: Make sure you have a solid internet connection. Pick a unique name that can differentiate you from your fellow players.
* Step 2: Either create a new lobby, or if someone has already made one, join theirs.
* Step 3: Once everyone from your party has joined the lobby, selected their starting role (hunter/runner), and the host has edited the settings, you are ready to start.
* Step 4: When the host clicks "START GAME" all the players will be put into the game. Runners have a head start before the hunters can catch them.
* Step 5: The goal for the runners is to evade capture for as long as possible. The goal for the hunters is to capture all the runners within the time limit. The hunters will be able to scan at regular intervals to see the runners' locations.
* Step 6: The game ends when either all the runners have been caught or the time limit runs out. Players will see the stats for the game before being brought back to the menu screen.

### In-game settings:
* Scan cooldown duration
* Map boundary (radius from initial location)
* Runner head start timer
* Starting hunters
* Game time limit
