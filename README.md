### What is Manhunt?
Manhunt is an app made by three friends (Muaz, Omar, and Julian) to extend the experience of the classic game of manhunt.

### How it works:
In the classic game of manhunt, one person – called the hunter – is "it". When the hunter catches a runner, they are "it" with them. The last runner left wins the game.

With the Manhunt app, everyone playing can simultaneously join a game that will track and let hunters see their locations in real-time when requested. This opens the playing field for more unique strategies and tactics from the hunters as well as allows for more variety in where and when you can play. 

### How to play:
* Step 1: Make sure you have an internet or data connection and location services/permissions enabled. Pick a unique name that can differentiate you from your fellow players.
* Step 2: Either create a new lobby, or if someone has already made one, join theirs.
* Step 3: Once everyone from your party has joined the lobby, selected their starting role (hunter/runner), and the host has edited the settings, you are ready to start.
* Step 4: When the host clicks "START GAME" all the players will be put into the game. Runners have a head start before the hunters can catch them.
* Step 5: The goal for the runners is to evade capture for as long as possible. The goal for the hunters is to capture all the runners within the time limit. The hunters will be able to scan at regular intervals to see the runners' locations.
* Step 6: The game ends when either all the runners have been caught or the time limit runs out. Players will then be remove from the game page to see the stats for the game. 

### In-game settings:
* Scan cooldown duration
* Map boundary (radius from start location)
* Runner head start timer
* Number of starting hunters
* Game time limit
